HW #2: Equivalent Arrays

Consider the two arrays a and b.
a = {1,2,3,4,5};
b = {3,4,5,1,2};

  It is possible to transform array a into array b by right shifting each element of a to the “right” three places. If an element “falls off” the back of the array have it come around the front and keep counting positions. That is how 3 in array ended up in the first position of array b. One way to look at this is to imagine that we are moving the element around in a circular manner.
  In the example above, we have right shifted the array 3 positions to the right.
Definition: Let a and b be two integer arrays of the same length. We say that they are “shift equivalent” if array a can be right shifted to create array b.
  Problem: Write a function bool equivalent(int a[], int b[], int n) which takes two arrays a and b of length n and returns true is they are shift equivalent and false otherwise.

HW #7: Write a program which allocates the integers 1-8 in a cross, subject to the restrictions that no two adjacent squares contain consecutive integers.
By adjacent we mean vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
